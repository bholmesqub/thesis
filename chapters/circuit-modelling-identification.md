# Circuit modelling and identification

## Black box modelling

Below is a video demonstrating the amplitude-dependent nature of nonlinearities, exemplified through the nonlinear impulse response of a diode clipper. The video was generated using MATLAB and code from

> *A. Novak, P. Lotton, and L. Simon, “Synchronized Swept-Sine: Theory, Application, and Implementation,” Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, vol. 63, pp. 786–798, Nov. 2015*.

As the input amplitude increases the output becomes more distorted and the first harmonic deviates from the ideal linear transfer function.

### Left plot

The black dashed line marks the hypothetical linear transfer function of a diode clipper should the input signal be sufficiently small. The remaining lines represent the amplitude response of a given harmonic. Over time the amplitude increases and the presence of the higher harmonics increase as well. Vp notes the peak input voltage

### Right plot

The time domain visualisation of a sine wave being processed by the diode clipper at the given amplitude. f0 marks the fundamental frequency of the sine wave.
